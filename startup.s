// The unified syntax was introduced with the ARMv6T2 and ARMv7
// architectures and allows for a more consistent assembly language

// unified directive tells the assembler to expect the unified syntax.

// This directive informs the assembler about the target CPU
// architecture or specific CPU variant. It helps the assembler
// understand which specific instructions and addressing modes are

// ARM CPUs can operate in different instruction set states. For most
// ARM architectures, these are ARM state and Thumb state. The
// Cortex-M series only supports the Thumb instruction set. The .thumb
// directive tells the assembler that the following code should be
// assembled using the Thumb instruction set.

// visible outside the object file. We define two symbols, one for the
// vector interrupt table and the reset handler.

        // The _estack value comes from the linker script and denotes
        // the position of the end the stack. Placing it as the first
        // word in the vector table means that it's used as the
        // initial stack pointer when the micro controller is powered
        // on or reset.

        // Next we place the address of the reset_handler label. In
        // ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, after the initial stack
        // pointer value, the next entry in the vector table is the
        // start address of the reset handler, which is the code that
